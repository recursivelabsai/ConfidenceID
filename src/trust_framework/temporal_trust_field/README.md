# ⏱️ Temporal Trust Field

This module implements the Temporal Trust Field component of ConfidenceID, which transforms trust from a static scalar value into a dynamic field that evolves over time.

## Overview

The Temporal Trust Field is a foundational component of the ConfidenceID trust ecosystem, directly addressing the "Symbolic Temporality" residue identified in `claude.metalayer.txt`. Traditional verification systems provide only snapshot assessments of content authenticity, failing to capture how trust signals evolve, decay, and amplify over time.

This component models trust as a multidimensional tensor with properties like:

- **Trust Velocity**: Rate of change in confidence
- **Trust Acceleration**: Change in rate of change
- **Trust Decay Constants**: Half-life of verification signals
- **Trust Amplification Factors**: Reinforcement from consistent verification

By representing trust as a dynamic field rather than a static value, ConfidenceID can provide more nuanced, context-aware trust assessments that account for verification history, temporal patterns, and the evolving nature of content authenticity.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Trust Modeling**: Represents trust as a field that evolves over time, not just as a static score
- **Temporal Weighting**: Weighs verification events based on recency and context
- **Content-Specific Dynamics**: Recognizes that different content types have different temporal properties
- **Trust Field Prediction**: Forecasts how trust will evolve based on current dynamics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in trust field dynamics
- **Beverly Band Analysis**: Visualizes the safe operating envelope for trust (the "Beverly Band")
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides ways to visualize trust as a dynamic field over time

## Architecture

The Temporal Trust Field component consists of the following key files:

- `field_tensors.py`: Defines the core data structures for representing trust as a multidimensional tensor
- `field_dynamics_engine.py`: Implements the mathematical models for how trust evolves over time
- `trust_field_visualizer.py`: Provides visualization tools for understanding trust field dynamics
- `temporal_weight.py`: Calculates the temporal impact of verification events
- `trust_field_store.py`: Manages persistence of trust field data

## Integration with ConfidenceID

The Temporal Trust Field component integrates with other parts of the ConfidenceID ecosystem:

- **Input Processors**: Provides temporal context for verification
- **Modality Analyzers**: Receives verification events from various modality-specific analyzers
- **Collective Memory**: Stores trust field histories in the verification fossil record
- **Decentralized Protocol**: Shares trust field data across the verification network
- **Information Compression**: Compresses trust field histories into dense signals
- **Embodied Interface**: Adapts trust field visualizations to different contexts

## Theoretical Foundation

The Temporal Trust Field is grounded in several theoretical principles:

1. **Trust Decay**: Trust signals naturally degrade over time at rates specific to content type and context
2. **Trust Amplification**: Consistent verification reinforces trust and makes it more resilient
3. **Trust Velocity**: The rate of change in trust is often as informative as the trust value itself
4. **Beverly Band**: There exists a dynamic stability envelope within which trust can safely evolve

The mathematical formulation of these principles is implemented in the `field_dynamics_engine.py` module, which provides equations for calculating how trust evolves over time based on verification events, temporal factors, and content-specific dynamics.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field import FieldDynamicsEngine
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field.field_tensors import VerificationEvent

# Create a dynamics engine
dynamics_engine = FieldDynamicsEngine()

# Process verification events
trust_tensor = dynamics_engine.calculate_trust_field(
    verification_history=[verification_event1, verification_event2],
    time_delta=1.0,  # hours since last update
    context_vector=current_context_vector
)

# Access trust field properties
confidence = trust_tensor.confidence
velocity = trust_tensor.velocity
stability = trust_tensor.stability

# Predict future state
future_tensor = dynamics_engine.predict_future_state(
    trust_tensor=trust_tensor,
    prediction_time=24.0  # hours in the future
)
```

### Visualization

```python
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field import TrustFieldVisualizer
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field.field_tensors import TrustFieldVisualizationConfig

# Create a visualizer with custom configuration
config = TrustFieldVisualizationConfig(
    show_confidence=True,
    show_velocity=True,
    show_stability=True,
    highlight_anomalies=True
)
visualizer = TrustFieldVisualizer(config=config)

# Create visualizations
fig = visualizer.visualize_time_series(time_series)
plt.savefig("trust_field_evolution.png")

# Visualize the Beverly Band
fig = visualizer.visualize_beverly_band(time_series)
plt.savefig("beverly_band.png")

# Export interactive visualizations to HTML
visualizer.export_to_html(time_series, "trust_field_analysis.html")
```

## Implementation Notes

### Content-Specific Dynamics

The Temporal Trust Field recognizes that different content types have different temporal properties. For example:

- **Text**: Typically has a slower decay rate as textual information tends to remain valid longer
- **Images**: Decay slightly faster than text as visual content can become outdated or manipulated
- **Audio**: Higher decay rate than images due to the ease of audio manipulation
- **Video**: Highest decay rate due to the complexity and rapid evolution of deepfake technologies
- **Cross-Modal**: Medium decay rate, as cross-modal verification adds additional constraints

These decay rates are configurable through the `default_decay_rates` parameter in `FieldDynamicsEngine`.

### Trust Field Anomaly Detection

The `detect_trust_anomalies` method in `FieldDynamicsEngine` identifies patterns that may indicate unusual behavior in trust field dynamics:

- **Acceleration Spikes**: Sudden changes in the rate of change of trust
- **Unstable Growth**: High velocity with low confidence
- **Rapid Decay**: Fast decreasing confidence
- **Low Stability**: Indication that the trust field is in a volatile state

These anomalies can be used to trigger alerts or additional verification.

### Beverly Band Calculation

The Beverly Band is a key concept from the Recursive Coherence framework described in our theoretical model. It represents the dynamic stability envelope of the trust field—the region within which trust can safely evolve without destabilizing the system.

The width of the Beverly Band is influenced by:

- **Tensor Stability**: Higher stability narrows the band (more precise)
- **Amplification**: Higher amplification widens the band (more potential for growth)
- **Decay Rate**: Higher decay rates widen the band (more volatility)

## Future Directions

The Temporal Trust Field component will continue to evolve along with the ConfidenceID ecosystem. Potential areas for enhancement include:

1. **Field Resonance Analysis**: Detecting how trust fields interact and resonate with each other
2. **Trust Field Prediction Models**: Advanced ML models to predict trust field evolution
3. **Multi-modal Field Integration**: Better integration of trust fields across different modalities
4. **Personalized Trust Dynamics**: Adapting temporal dynamics to user preferences and history
5. **Trust Field Compression**: More efficient representation of trust field dynamics for storage and transmission
