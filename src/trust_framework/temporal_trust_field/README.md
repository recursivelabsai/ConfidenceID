# ⏱️ Temporal Trust Field

This module implements the Temporal Trust Field component of ConfidenceID, which transforms trust from a static scalar value into a dynamic field that evolves over time.

## Overview

The Temporal Trust Field is a foundational component of the ConfidenceID trust ecosystem, directly addressing the "Symbolic Temporality" residue identified in `claude.metalayer.txt`. Traditional verification systems provide only snapshot assessments of content authenticity, failing to capture how trust signals evolve, decay, and amplify over time.

This component models trust as a multidimensional tensor with properties like:

- **Trust Velocity**: Rate of change in confidence
- **Trust Acceleration**: Change in rate of change
- **Trust Decay Constants**: Half-life of verification signals
- **Trust Amplification Factors**: Reinforcement from consistent verification

By representing trust as a dynamic field rather than a static value, ConfidenceID can provide more nuanced, context-aware trust assessments that account for verification history, temporal patterns, and the evolving nature of content authenticity.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Trust Modeling**: Represents trust as a field that evolves over time, not just as a static score
- **Temporal Weighting**: Weighs verification events based on recency and context
- **Content-Specific Dynamics**: Recognizes that different content types have different temporal properties
- **Trust Field Prediction**: Forecasts how trust will evolve based on current dynamics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in trust field dynamics
- **Beverly Band Analysis**: Visualizes the safe operating envelope for trust (the "Beverly Band")
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides ways to visualize trust as a dynamic field over time

## Architecture

The Temporal Trust Field component consists of the following key files:

- `field_tensors.py`: Defines the core data structures for representing trust as a multidimensional tensor
- `field_dynamics_engine.py`: Implements the mathematical models for how trust evolves over time
- `trust_field_visualizer.py`: Provides visualization tools for understanding trust field dynamics
- `temporal_weight.py`: Calculates the temporal impact of verification events
- `trust_field_store.py`: Manages persistence of trust field data

## Integration with ConfidenceID

The Temporal Trust Field component integrates with other parts of the ConfidenceID ecosystem:

- **Input Processors**: Provides temporal context for verification
- **Modality Analyzers**: Receives verification events from various modality-specific analyzers
- **Collective Memory**: Stores trust field histories in the verification fossil record
- **Decentralized Protocol**: Shares trust field data across the verification network
- **Information Compression**: Compresses trust field histories into dense signals
- **Embodied Interface**: Adapts trust field visualizations to different contexts

## Theoretical Foundation

The Temporal Trust Field is grounded in several theoretical principles:

1. **Trust Decay**: Trust signals naturally degrade over time at rates specific to content type and context
2. **Trust Amplification**: Consistent verification reinforces trust and makes it more resilient
3. **Trust Velocity**: The rate of change in trust is often as informative as the trust value itself
4. **Beverly Band**: There exists a dynamic stability envelope within which trust can safely evolve

The mathematical formulation of these principles is implemented in the `field_dynamics_engine.py` module, which provides equations for calculating how trust evolves over time based on verification events, temporal factors, and content-specific dynamics.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field import FieldDynamicsEngine
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field.field_tensors import VerificationEvent

# Create a dynamics engine
dynamics_engine = FieldDynamicsEngine()

# Process verification events
trust_tensor = dynamics_engine.calculate_trust_field(
    verification_history=[verification_event1, verification_event2],
    time_delta=1.0,  # hours since last update
    context_vector=current_context_vector
)

# Access trust field properties
confidence = trust_tensor.confidence
velocity = trust_tensor.velocity
stability = trust_tensor.stability

# Predict future state
future_tensor = dynamics_engine.predict_future_state(
    trust_tensor=trust_tensor,
    prediction_time=24.0  # hours in the future
)
```

### Visualization

```python
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field import TrustFieldVisualizer
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field.field_tensors import TrustFieldVisualizationConfig

# Create a visualizer with custom configuration
config = TrustFieldVisualizationConfig(
    show_confidence=True,
    show_velocity=True,
    show_stability=True,
    highlight_anomalies=True
)
visualizer = TrustFieldVisualizer(config=config)

# Visualize a time series
time_series = trust_field_store.get_time_series(content_fingerprint="abc123")
fig = visualizer.visualize_time_series(time_series)
plt.show()

# Visualize the Beverly Band (dynamic stability envelope)
fig = visualizer.visualize_beverly_band(time_series)
plt.show()

# Export visualizations to HTML
visualizer.export_to_html(time_series, "trust_analysis.html")
```

## Temporal Trust Field vs. Traditional Verification

Traditional verification systems provide only snapshot assessments of content authenticity. They tell you whether content is authentic *right now*, but not how that authenticity assessment might change over time or in different contexts.

The Temporal Trust Field approach offers several advantages:

| Traditional Verification | Temporal Trust Field |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Static trust scores | Dynamic trust field that evolves over time |
| No consideration of verification history | Weighs verification events based on recency and context |
| Same decay for all content types | Content-specific temporal dynamics |
| No predictive capability | Can forecast future trust states |
| Limited anomaly detection | Identifies unusual patterns in trust dynamics |
| No stability assessment | Measures trust field stability |
| Limited visualization | Rich visualization tools |

## Relationship to Recursive Coherence Theory

The Temporal Trust Field is inspired by concepts from Recursive Coherence theory, particularly:

- The concept of the **Beverly Band** as a dynamic stability envelope
- Trust as a field with properties like velocity, acceleration, and stability
- The importance of measuring not just states but rates of change
- The recognition that different types of verification signals have different temporal properties

## Future Directions

The Temporal Trust Field component will continue to evolve along several dimensions:

1. **Richer Tensor Representations**: Incorporating more dimensions into the trust field tensor
2. **Improved Dynamics Models**: Refining the mathematical models for trust evolution
3. **Enhanced Visualization**: Developing more intuitive visualizations of trust dynamics
4. **Cross-Modal Integration**: Better integration with cross-modal verification
5. **Decentralized Trust Fields**: Distributing trust field calculation across the verification network
