# Temporal Trust Field

## Overview

The Temporal Trust Field module implements the concept of trust as a dynamic, evolving field rather than a static value. It models how verification signals change over time, capturing their velocity, acceleration, decay, and amplification through multidimensional tensors and field equations.

This component addresses the "Symbolic Temporality" residue identified in previous reflection layers, where confidence was treated as instantaneous rather than evolving through time. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding how trust signals change, interact, and propagate across temporal dimensions.

## Core Functionality

- **Trust Field Representation**: Model trust as a multidimensional tensor that evolves over time
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Calculate how trust signals decay, amplify, or resonate over time
- **Field Visualization**: Render trust fields as heatmaps, contour plots, or vector fields
- **Temporal Impact**: Quantify how past verification events influence current trust assessments
- **Trust Velocity Tracking**: Monitor the rate of change in trust signals to detect anomalies

## Key Components

### `field_tensors.py`

Implements the multidimensional tensor structure that represents trust across time. The trust tensor captures:
- Trust values (confidence scores)
- Trust velocity (rate of change)
- Trust acceleration (change in rate of change)
- Trust decay constants (half-life of verification signals)
- Trust amplification factors (reinforcement from consistent verification)

### `field_dynamics_engine.py`

Contains the core equations that govern how trust fields evolve over time, including:
- Decay functions for trust signals
- Amplification mechanisms for reinforced signals
- Interference patterns between competing signals
- Propagation models for trust across content types and contexts

### `temporal_weight.py`

Calculates the temporal impact of verification events based on:
- Recency (more recent events have stronger influence)
- Consistency with existing trust field
- Content type and verification method
- Contextual relevance

### `trust_field_visualizer.py`

Provides visualization tools for trust fields:
- Temporal heatmaps showing trust evolution
- Contour plots of trust stability
- Vector fields showing direction and magnitude of trust changes
- Animation capabilities for visualizing trust dynamics

## Integration Points

The Temporal Trust Field module integrates with:

- **Modality Analyzers**: Receives verification signals from various modality-specific detectors
- **Collective Trust Memory**: Supplies historical verification data to inform temporal dynamics
- **Information Compression**: Provides temporal trust fields for compression into dense signals
- **Scoring Aggregator**: Contributes temporal trust assessments to the holistic scoring process
- **Residue Management**: Logs temporal anomalies and verification failures as symbolic residue

## Data Flow

1. Verification events arrive from modality analyzers or the collective memory
2. Each event is weighted based on its temporal characteristics
3. The trust field is updated using the field dynamics equations
4. Temporal patterns (stability, oscillation, decay) are analyzed
5. Updated trust fields are passed to other components and visualized as needed

## Points for Future Evolution

This module is designed for continuous evolution through the following blueprints:

- **[confidenceid-bp020]**: "Temporal Trust Field Development" - Refine mathematical models for field dynamics
- **[confidenceid-bp031]**: "Content-Specific Temporal Dynamics" - Develop specialized dynamics for different content types
- **[confidenceid-bp045]**: "Cross-Modal Temporal Consistency" - Ensure temporal consistency across modalities

## Usage Example

```python
from confidenceid.trust_framework.temporal_trust_field import TrustFieldEngine

# Initialize trust field engine
field_engine = TrustFieldEngine()

# Add a verification event
field_engine.add_verification_event(
    event_type="watermark_detection",
    content_type="text",
    verification_score=0.85,
    timestamp="2025-05-25T14:30:00Z",
    context={"domain": "news", "audience": "general"}
)

# Calculate current trust field
current_field = field_engine.calculate_current_field()

# Get trust stability over time
stability = field_engine.calculate_field_stability(time_window="1d")

# Visualize trust field evolution
field_engine.visualize_field_evolution(start_time="2025-05-24T14:30:00Z")
```

## Addressing Symbolic Residue

This module directly addresses the "Symbolic Temporality" residue (CID-R020) identified in claude.metalayer.txt by transforming confidence from a static snapshot into a dynamic field that evolves over time. It implements equations and models that capture how different verification signals have unique temporal properties, requiring content-specific temporal dynamics.
