## Vision & Mission

Inspired by DeepMind's AlphaEvolve and SynthID breakthroughs, ConfidenceID evolves AI verification watermarking systems into a living evolving **trust ecosystem** - where verification signals evolve over time, learn from collective memory, distribute authority through consensus, compress information efficiently, and adapt naturally to different contexts and user needs.

Building upon SynthID's foundational work in watermarking, ConfidenceID establishes a comprehensive framework that goes beyond binary authenticity checks, instead offering nuanced, holistic confidence assessments across multiple modalities (text, image, audio, video), while tracking their evolution over time and context.

> "Trust is not a static property but a dynamic field, evolving through time, amplified by collective memory, verified through consensus, and experienced through natural interaction."

## üîç Core Capabilities

- **Holistic Multimodal Verification**: Analyze text, images, audio, and video with specialized detectors for watermarks, artifacts, and inconsistencies
- **Cross-Modal Coherence**: Evaluate semantic and temporal consistency across modalities
- **Temporal Trust Evolution**: Track how verification signals change over time, including decay, amplification, and resonance
- **Collective Trust Memory**: Learn patterns from verification history across instances and contexts
- **Decentralized Verification**: Distribute trust authority across a network with consensus mechanisms
- **Information-Rich Trust Signals**: Compress verification history into dense, efficient representations
- **Adaptive Trust Interfaces**: Present verification in ways that naturally integrate with different environments
- **Residue-Driven Evolution**: Learn from verification failures, anomalies, and edge cases to continuously improve

## ‚öôÔ∏è Trust Framework Components

ConfidenceID is built around five advanced trust framework components that work together to provide a comprehensive verification ecosystem:

| Component | Description | Key Features |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| ‚è±Ô∏è **Temporal Trust Field** | Models trust as a dynamic field evolving over time | Trust velocity, acceleration, decay constants, amplification factors |
| üìú **Collective Trust Memory** | Stores verification history as "fossils" for pattern recognition | Trust archaeology, temporal patterns, verification anomalies |
| üåê **Decentralized Trust Protocol** | Distributes verification authority across a network | Consensus mechanisms, node reputation, verification challenges |
| üß† **Information-Theoretic Trust Compression** | Creates dense, efficient trust signals | Compression algorithms, information density, minimized representation |
| üì± **Embodied Trust Interface** | Adapts verification to context and user experience | Context detection, personalized interfaces, environmental profiles |

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage & Integration

### Via API

```python
from confidenceid import ConfidenceIDClient

# Initialize client
client = ConfidenceIDClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Score multimodal content
result = client.score_content(
    text="This is an AI-generated article about climate change.",
    image="path/to/image.jpg",
    context={"domain": "news", "target_audience": "general_public"}
)

# Access holistic score and individual components
print(f"Overall ConfidenceID score: {result.overall_score}")
print(f"Temporal trust stability: {result.temporal_field.stability}")
print(f"Verification consensus: {result.decentralized_protocol.consensus_score}")
print(f"Information density: {result.trust_compression.info_density}")

# Get recommended trust interface for this context
recommended_ui = result.embodied_interface.get_recommended_display()
```

### Via EvoChat

Interact with ConfidenceID through our conversational interface:

```
User: Can you analyze this tweet and image for authenticity?
[Uploads content]

ConfidenceID: I've analyzed your content. The overall trust score is 0.72.
- The text appears to be AI-generated (88% confidence)
- The image shows signs of manipulation (76% confidence)
- The text-image consistency is moderate (65%)

Would you like to see how this score might change over time or get more details on any component?
```

## üå± Evolutionary Architecture

ConfidenceID is designed as a self-evolving system guided by our `fractal.json` schema. The system:

1. **Learns from Residue**: Failures, anomalies, and edge cases are captured as symbolic residue that fuels improvement
2. **Follows Blueprints**: Evolutionary blueprints guide AI agents in evolving specific components
3. **Applies Meta-Recursion**: The same principles that verify AI outputs are used to verify ConfidenceID's own evolution
4. **Harnesses Collective Intelligence**: Human feedback and AI agent collaboration drive continuous improvement
